This tool aims at analyzes methylation states from bisulphite sequencing data. This pipeline will take as input raw reads of Bisulphite Sequencing and output SNP calls. 

Directories are as follows:
- **bin**: contains custom scripts for alignment, SNP calling, and others 

- **data**: contains data for analysis. 

- **logs**: as this tool is meant to be used with slurm scheduler, logs from slurm jobs will be stored here.

- **temps**: will contain temporary files and other files generated during analysis.
